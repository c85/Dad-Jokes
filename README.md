# Dadsaysjokes Python Script

## What's New:
2022-02-19: I moved all my code to an Azure function as well as adding some error handling that was not in the previous version.

## Description:
I wanted to write an app that sends daily dad jokes to myself, as well as friends and family, so I decided to do some web scraping using the Twitter API from one of the best pages on the internet...the Dad Jokes Twitter page [@dadsaysjokes](https://twitter.com/Dadsaysjokes)! As I began writing the code, I also decided to include Mark Normand's Twitter account because he's hilarious and felt his style of humor aligns with the dad jokes theme I'm going for.
