# Dad Jokes Python Script

## What's New:
2022-02-19: I moved all my code to an Azure function as well as adding some error handling that was not in the previous version.

## Description:
<<<<<<< HEAD
I wanted to write an app that sends daily dad jokes to myself, as well as friends and family, so I decided to do some web scraping using the Twitter API from one of the best pages on the internet...the Dad Jokes Twitter page [@dadsaysjokes](https://twitter.com/Dadsaysjokes)! As I began writing the code, I also decided to include Mark Normand's Twitter account because he's hilarious and felt his style of humor aligns with the dad jokes theme I'm going for.

This script stores all of the steps to extract and transform the data, then send it via SMS and Email inside a dadsaysjokes_task() function, which is then scheduled using [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io). As I began writing the code, I also decided to include Mark Normand's Twitter account because he's hilarious and felt his style of humor aligns with the dad jokes theme I'm going for.
